Tic Tac Toe

I am making this in-browser game for The Odin Project

This application uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My learning goal for this project is to learn to code this game using: factory functions, modules, and with as little global variables as possible- as per the last TOP lesson.
